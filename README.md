# Introduction

I decided to make a brand new and unique Discord user interface for everyone that wanted to experience something new, and it was specially designed for all those members that are a huge fan of my Discord Server called, well, Sparkly, hehe. Yes, just like the Theme :)

# Installation

First of all you must download ***LightCord***, an application that contains the basic code that will interprete the theme. It's simple to install and is safe(not 100% safe since all applications that edits the original one won't be safe. Most of offline applications should be safe when modifying the original code, however, that might not be the case with applications that contains online features such as ***Discord*** because it might be against their ***ToS***).
