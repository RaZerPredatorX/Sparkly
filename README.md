# Introduction

I decided to make a brand new and unique Discord user interface for everyone that wanted to experience something new, and it was specially designed for all those members that are a huge fan of my Discord Server called, well, ***Sparkly***, hehe. Yes, just like the Theme :)

# Installation of the Client

First of all you must download ***LightCord***, an application that contains the basic code that will interprete the theme. It's simple to install and is safe(not 100% safe since all applications that edits the original one won't be safe. Most of offline applications should be safe when modifying the original code, however, that might not be the case with applications that contains online features such as ***Discord*** because it might be against their ***ToS***).

Access this link https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord/releases and download the latest stable release for your platform (**must be the installer unless you know what you're doing**). After it's downloaded just open the executable and it will install everything automatically.

After the client installation is done you should now have a shortcut on your Desktop called ***LightDiscord***, you don't need to have the original Discord open in order to use it, you can even unninstall the original one and just use the standole client we just installed.
